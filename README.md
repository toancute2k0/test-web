# DarkMatter (Layer 7 DDoS)

Dark Matter is a Stresser that attacks on Layer 7, i have been developing this for a time... i guess it is one of the betters free-opensource DDoS Scripts. **(this is for testing purposes only or if you are allowed to perform the ddos attack)**

**Features:**

**- DDoS Simulation: It can simulate a real DDoS with big power**

**- RateLimit bypass: It have 2 bypasses for rate-limiting**

**- Powerful: The power average is 900k requests and max. power is between 2Millions-6Millions requests depending on your VPS power, 1M is easy to reach with a common VPS**

**- OpenSource: It is 'opensource', then u can edit or use this to create ur own stresser**

**- Firewall Bypass: It have some firewall rules bypass**

**- Free: Free for download, Free for use... u dont need to pay anything**

**- No-Threads: It uses a different technology instead of threads, it means that it wont make ur computer burn and u dont need too much threads in your CPU**

**Requeriments to run:**

**- FIRST OF ALL: DONT RUN IN YOUR OWN MACHINE IF IT IS JUST A HOME-DESKTOP, HOME-LAPTOP OR ANY HOME-COMPUTER... IF UR MACHINE IS REALLY REALLY GOOD FOR THIS, TRY RUNNING THE ATTACK IN THIS MACHINE IN A REMOTEACCESS, OR U CANT SEE THE TRUE POWER**
---------------------------------------------
- 2+ cores CPU
- 400MBits/s Internet Speed **(Upload)**
- 1 GB Ram Free
- Recommended using VPS with linux, but u can use another OS (Windows), MAC is not recommended but it is up to you


The requeriments is not too much, right ?
